Last night you learned how to to *CURD*, tonight you learn how to... make Pinterest but it's allllll cheese. 

## Completion

Please finish through __Part 5__. As always: more is cheddar; gourmet is betta.

## Part 1: Setup

- Make sure last night's homework is complete because this builds off of it. 

## Part 2: The Great User of Cheeses

- Add Users to your cheese app. Follow the same instructions you used to add users to planets in class today. 
- Don't forget to include Username in the migration file!

## Part 3: "Cheesey user forms!"

- Add `username` to the registration form
- A signed in user can see their profile page, which includes all of their info.

## Part 4: Users can have favorite cheeses!

- If a user is signed in, they can add a cheese to their favorites. 
- Create a join table called `favorites` that has two columns: `user_id` and `cheese_id`.
- If a User favorites a cheese, it creates a new Favorite in the database.

## Part 5: Eat the Cheese, You Fool

 - Users want to see all of their favorite cheeses!
 - Display a list of User.favorites in the user profile. 

## SUPER Bonus

 - Style all of the forms
 - Add a nav partial to the application.html.erb file
 - View a list of all users and their favorite cheeses
